# What is this?

Wallpapers are essential elements of your setup. I've always been looking for new ones, searching on various repos and websites. However, I realised that I only ended up using a little of them, and sometimes none at all because I either didn't like them or they were too distracting.

This collection only features the wallpapers that I actually use or am currently using. While it may seem a little empty, the intention is to create a selection of high-quality wallpapers, rather than a huge repo (I'm trying to say that this isn't a repo for mass wallpaper collections)

If you'd like to contribute a wallpaper, simply submit a pull request, and I'll be sure to take a look at it.
